            <p></p>
            <h3>Educational and Professional Background</h3>
            <p>I have a <b>first class BSc in Computer Science from the University of Salford</b>. During my time at Salford I was involved heavily in the Computing Society, first
            as Vice President in my first year, then as President in my second and finally as an advisor in my third. I have organised trips, talks, hackathons, social events
            and various other events.</p>
            <p>I had the opportunity in my second year to see if doing a PhD would be right for me. I was awarded a <b>EPSRC Summer Research Studentship at Lancaster Operations Research</b></p>
            <p>During my third year at Salford I was employed a <b>teaching assistant</b> for the first year programming module part time. This was a trial of students being involved in teaching activities and I was chosen due to my experience in mentoring and assissting students through the Computing Society. I was able to be involved with answering student questions in practicals, invigilating exams, marking student demos, mentoring students who were struggling with their work, mentoring students who were passionate about computer science, run workshops on my own, help develop mark schemes and assist a lecturer with whatever other tasks were required. Due to how well this went for me the program has now been expanded to give more students the same experience.</p>
            <p>After Graduating I worked as a <b>Data Scientist for a Utility Broker</b> where I was tasked with creating vauable insights from data. This included the development of a
            data warehousing solution to allow the company to see past data on a company. In this project I was the lead engineer, managing the project, gathering requirements, developing the systems including a bespoke ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading), creating documentation and training my coworkers on the system. I also created dynamic reports to show sales figures and creating machine learning models to better understand sales performance. In addition to my data science role I was involved in the continued development of the internal bespoke CRM and creating a post-live system for use by admin staff including requirements gathering with admin staff members.</p>
            <p>I am now a <b>PhD Student at Cranfield Defence and Security</b> due to submit in 2021</p>
